## NEW in v2.0.0 — Import Your Discord History

> **Leaving Discord?** Haven can import your entire server's message history — directly from the app. No external tools, no command-line exports, no hassle.

Open **Settings → Import** and connect with your Discord token. Haven pulls every channel, thread, forum post, announcement, reaction, pin, attachment, and avatar — then lets you map them to Haven channels. Your community's history comes with you.

- **Direct Connect** — paste your Discord token, pick a server, select channels & threads, import
- **File Upload** — or upload a DiscordChatExporter JSON/ZIP if you prefer
- **Full fidelity** — messages, replies, embeds, attachments, reactions, pins, forum tags, all preserved
- **Discord avatars** — imported messages show the original author's Discord profile picture
- **All channel types** — text, announcement, forum, media, plus active & archived threads

Your entire Discord history, now on a server you own. No one can delete it, no one can read it, no one can take it away.

---

## Quick Start — Docker (Recommended)

**Option A — Pre-built image** (fastest, easiest updates):
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/ancsemi/haven:latest
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -v haven_data:/data ghcr.io/ancsemi/haven:latest
```

Or with Docker Compose (recommended):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ancsemi/Haven.git
cd Haven
docker compose up -d
```
The shipped `docker-compose.yml` uses the pre-built image by default.

**Option B — Build from source** (only if you need to modify the code):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ancsemi/Haven.git
cd Haven
```
Uncomment `build: .` in `docker-compose.yml`, then:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Open `https://localhost:3000` → Register with username `admin` → Create a channel → Share the code with friends. Done.

> Certificate warning is normal — click **Advanced → Proceed**. Haven uses a self-signed cert for encryption.

**Updating** — if using the pre-built image (default):
```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d --force-recreate
```

**Check your version**: visit `https://localhost:3000/api/version` in your browser.

**Option C — One-click cloud deploy** (Zeabur):

[![Deploy on Zeabur](https://zeabur.com/button.svg)](https://zeabur.com/templates?repoURL=https://github.com/ancsemi/Haven)

## Quick Start — Windows (No Docker)

1. Download and unzip this repository
2. Double-click **`Start Haven.bat`**
3. If Node.js isn't installed, the script will offer to install it for you automatically

That's it. The batch file handles everything — Node.js installation, dependencies, SSL certificates, config — and opens your browser. Register as `admin` to get started.

> **Don't have Node.js?** No problem. The launcher detects this and can install it for you with one keypress. Or install it yourself from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) and restart your PC.

## Quick Start — Linux / macOS (No Docker)

```bash
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh
```

Or manually: `npm install && node server.js`

---

## Who Is This For?

- **Small friend groups** who want a private place to talk
- **Self-hosters** who run services on their own hardware
- **Privacy-conscious communities** done with Big Tech
- **LAN gaming crews** who need voice + screen share without Discord
- **Homelab enthusiasts** looking for a lightweight chat service

## Letting Friends Connect Over the Internet

If your friends aren't on your WiFi, you need to open a port on your router.

### Step 1 — Find Your Public IP

Go to [whatismyip.com](https://whatismyip.com). That's the address your friends will use.

### Step 2 — Port Forward

1. Log into your router (usually `http://192.168.1.1` or `http://10.0.0.1`)
2. Find **Port Forwarding** (sometimes called NAT or Virtual Servers)
3. Forward port **3000** (TCP) to your PC's local IP
4. Save

> **Find your local IP:** Open Command Prompt → type `ipconfig` → look for IPv4 Address (e.g. `192.168.1.50`)

### Step 3 — Windows Firewall

Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:
```powershell
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Haven Chat" -Direction Inbound -LocalPort 3000 -Protocol TCP -Action Allow
```

### Step 4 — Share With Friends

Send them:
```
https://YOUR_PUBLIC_IP:3000
```

Tell them to click **Advanced** → **Proceed** on the certificate warning. It's normal.

---

## Configuration

Haven creates a `.env` config file automatically on first launch — you don't need to create or rename anything. It lives in your **data directory**:

| OS | Data Directory |
|----|---------------|
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\Haven\` |
| Linux / macOS | `~/.haven/` |

| Setting | Default | What It Does |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `PORT` | `3000` | Server port |
| `SERVER_NAME` | `Haven` | Your server's display name |
| `ADMIN_USERNAME` | `admin` | Register with this name to get admin powers |
| `JWT_SECRET` | *(auto-generated)* | Security key — don't share or edit this |
| `SSL_CERT_PATH` | *(auto-detected)* | Path to SSL certificate |
| `SSL_KEY_PATH` | *(auto-detected)* | Path to SSL private key |
| `HAVEN_DATA_DIR` | *(see above)* | Override the data directory location |

After editing `.env`, restart the server.

## Voice Chat

1. Join a text channel
2. Click **🎤 Join Voice**
3. Allow microphone access
4. Adjust anyone's volume with their slider
5. Click **📞 Leave** when done

Voice is peer-to-peer — audio goes directly between users, not through the server. Requires HTTPS.

- **Join / leave cues** — synthesized audio tones when users enter or leave voice.
- **Talking indicators** — usernames glow green when speaking (300 ms hysteresis for smooth animation).
- **Screen sharing** — click **🖥️ Share Screen** to broadcast your display. Multiple users can share simultaneously in a tiled grid.

---

## Admin Guide

If you registered with the admin username, you can:

- **Create / delete channels**
- **Kick users** — disconnects them (they can rejoin)
- **Mute users** — timed mute (can't send messages)
- **Ban users** — permanent ban (can't connect)
- **Delete users** — remove banned accounts (frees up their username)
- **Auto-cleanup** — configure automatic deletion of old messages (Settings → Admin)
- **Server settings** — EULA, max message age, DB size limits

Access admin controls in the **Settings** panel (⚙️ gear icon in the sidebar).

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| "SSL_ERROR_RX_RECORD_TOO_LONG" | Your browser is using `https://` but the server is running HTTP. **Change the URL to `http://localhost:3000`**, or install OpenSSL and restart to enable HTTPS (see below). |
| "Node.js is not installed" | The launcher offers to install it automatically. Or run `winget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS` in a terminal, restart, and try again. |
| Browser shows blank page | Clear cache or try incognito/private window |
| Friends can't connect | Check port forwarding + firewall. Make sure server is running. |
| "Error: EADDRINUSE" | Another app is using port 3000. Change `PORT` in `.env`. |
| Voice chat echoes | Use headphones |
| Voice doesn't work remotely | Must use `https://`, not `http://` |
| Certificate error in browser | Normal — click Advanced → Proceed |

### HTTPS / SSL Details

Haven **automatically generates self-signed SSL certificates** on first launch — but only if **OpenSSL** is installed on your system.

**How to tell which mode you're in:** Look at the startup banner in the terminal window. If the URL shows `http://` — you're on HTTP. If it shows `https://` — you're on HTTPS.

**If Haven falls back to HTTP** (no OpenSSL, or cert generation failed):
- Everything works fine for local use — just use `http://localhost:3000`
- Voice chat will only work on localhost, not for remote friends
- To enable HTTPS:
  1. Install OpenSSL: [slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html](https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html) (the "Light" version)
  2. During install, choose "Copy OpenSSL DLLs to the Windows system directory"
  3. Restart your PC
  4. Delete `%APPDATA%\Haven\certs` and re-launch `Start Haven.bat`

---

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Shift+Enter` | New line |
| `Ctrl+F` | Search messages |
| `@` | @mention autocomplete |
| `:` | Emoji autocomplete (type 2+ chars) |
| `/` | Slash command autocomplete |
| `Tab` | Select autocomplete suggestion |

---

## Backing Up Your Data

All your data lives in a dedicated directory **outside** the Haven code folder:

| OS | Location |
|----|----------|
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\Haven\` |
| Linux / macOS | `~/.haven/` |

Inside you'll find:
- **`haven.db`** — all messages, users, and channels
- **`.env`** — your configuration
- **`certs/`** — SSL certificates
- **`uploads/`** — uploaded images

Copy the entire folder somewhere safe to back up everything. The Haven code directory contains no personal data.

---

## GIF Search — GIPHY API Setup

Haven has a built-in GIF picker powered by **GIPHY**. To enable it you need a free API key.

### 1. Create a GIPHY Developer Account

1. Go to [developers.giphy.com](https://developers.giphy.com/)
2. Sign up for an account (or sign in)

### 2. Create an App

1. Click **Create an App**
2. Choose **API** (not SDK)
3. Give it any name (e.g. "Haven Chat") and a short description
4. Copy the **API Key** shown on the next page

### 3. Add the Key in Haven

1. Log into Haven as your **admin** account
2. Click the **GIF button** (🎞️) in the message input area
3. You'll see a setup prompt — paste your API key and save
4. The key is stored server-side in the database — only admins can see or change it

That's it. All users can now search and send GIFs.

> **Free tier:** GIPHY's free tier allows plenty of requests for a private chat server — you'll never come close to the limit.
