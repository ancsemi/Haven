# Haven Desktop — Audio Drivers

Place virtual audio cable drivers here for bundling with the installer.

## VB-CABLE (Recommended — Free)

1. Download from https://vb-audio.com/Cable/
2. Extract the zip
3. Place `VBCABLE_Setup_x64.exe` in this folder

The installer will optionally install it during Haven Desktop setup,
and the app can also install it on-demand from the audio routing panel.

## File structure expected:

```
audio-drivers/
  VBCABLE_Setup_x64.exe    ← Windows 64-bit installer
  VBCABLE_Setup.exe        ← Windows 32-bit installer (optional)
```
